        What is a Frontend Developer
      </h1>
      <p className="my-6 nunito w-11/12 md:w-4/5 lg:w-2/3 m-auto">
        A Frontend Developer specializes in building the visual and interactive
        parts of websites and web applications that users interact with
        directly. This involves creating interfaces using HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript, and ensuring that the design is responsive, user-friendly,
        and performs well across different devices and browsers. Frontend
        developers focus on implementing design mockups, adding interactivity,
        optimizing performance, and enhancing the overall user experience.

        Why backend?
      </h1>
      <p className="my-6 nunito w-11/12 md:w-4/5 lg:w-2/3 m-auto">
        Although my primary focus has been on frontend development, I am
        learning backend technologies like Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to
        become a more versatile developer. Understanding both frontend and
        backend allows me to work on entire projects independently, improve
        collaboration with backend developers, and troubleshoot issues more
        effectively. Additionally, having a broad skill set opens up more career
        opportunities and enables me to contribute to various aspects of a
        project, making me a more valuable asset in the tech industry.
