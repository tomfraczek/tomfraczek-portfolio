      <p className="my-6 nunito">
        I am a dedicated Frontend Developer with a passion for creating web and
        mobile applications using React and React Native technologies. My
        journey in development began in London in 2017, where I started as a
        freelancer, crafting my first commercial websites.
      </p>
      <p className="my-6 nunito">
        The next step in my career was joining a London-based company. Here, I
        had the opportunity to use the React library in a real-world
        environment, creating interfaces and collaborating with a talented team.
        This experience was instrumental in honing my skills and understanding
        the practical applications of React.
      </p>
      <p className="my-6 nunito">
        The highlight of my career so far has been my time at a software house,
        where I could focus entirely on advancing my hard programming skills as
        a React Developer. This role allowed me to grow technically and solidify
        my expertise in building sophisticated and efficient applications.
      </p>

      <p className="my-6 nunito">
        In addition to my frontend expertise, I have also started developing my
        skills in backend technologies such as Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. My
        goal is to become a complete developer, capable of handling both
        frontend and backend development seamlessly.
      </p>
      <p className="my-6 nunito">
        At work I am known for my positive attitude, goal-oriented personality,
        and strong motivation to continually enhance my skills.
      </p>
      <p className="my-6 nunito">
        Programming is not just my profession but also a source of joy and
        fulfillment for me. I am always eager to take on new challenges and push
        the boundaries of what can be achieved through code.
